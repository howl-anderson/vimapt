## pureyaml
`VPB` format based on `YAML`. 
For the function of vimapt, a yaml loader and dumper are needed. 
`PyYAML` is the most popular choose, but it's not implement in python,
it need compile or install via pip. 
but `VimApt` has a goal to be a out of box software.
So `PyYAML` is not suit for this project. `pureyaml` is a alternative one.

`VimApt` directly include `pureyaml` then install it by pip. So **notice `pureyaml` is not part of `VimApt` project.**
